2025-04-21 17:16:54,980 | INFO     | __main__:120 | Generated response: Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity actually comes in two parts:

1. Special Relativity (1905)  
   • Key idea: the laws of physics (including the speed of light) are the same for all non‑accelerating observers.  
   • Consequences: time dilation (moving clocks tick more slowly), length contraction (moving objects shorten), and the famous equation E = mc².

2. General Relativity (1915)  
   • Extends relativity to include gravity by describing it as the warping of space and time (“spacetime”) by mass and energy.  
   • Predicts phenomena like gravitational time dilation (clocks run slower near massive bodies), the bending of light around stars, and black holes.

Why it matters today:  
• GPS satellites must correct for both special and general relativistic effects to keep location data accurate.  
• Modern astrophysics and cosmology—from predicting the expansion of the universe to detecting gravitational waves—rest on relativity’s framework.
